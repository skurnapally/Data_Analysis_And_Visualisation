You can see the columns ‘Age’ and ‘Cabin’ have some missing values.\n","\n","<center> <img src = 'https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/39935Missing%20Values%201.png' width = 600></center>\n","\n","Some of the reasons awhy data is missing:\n","\n","1. Past data might get corrupted due to improper maintenance.\n","2. Observations are not recorded for certain fields due to some reasons. There might be a failure in recording the values due to human error.\n","3. The user has not provided the values intentionally.\n","\n","Types of Missing Values:\n","\n","https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/63807Types.png\n","\n","### Missing Completely At Random (MCAR):\n","\n","* In MCAR, the probability of data being missing is the same for all the observations.\n","\n","* In this case, there is no relationship between the missing data and any other values observed or unobserved (the data which is not recorded) within the given dataset.\n","\n","* That is, missing values are completely independent of other data. There is no pattern.\n","\n","* In the case of MCAR, the data could be missing due to human error, some system/equipment failure, loss of sample, or some unsatisfactory technicalities while recording the values.\n","\n","### Missing At Random (MAR)\n","\n","* Missing at random (MAR) means that the reason for missing values can be explained by variables on which you have complete information as there is some relationship between the missing data and other values/data.\n","\n","* In this case, the data is not missing for all the observations. It is missing only within sub-samples of the data and there is some pattern in the missing values.\n","\n","### Missing Not At Random (MNAR)\n","\n","* Missing values depend on the unobserved data.\n","\n","* If there is some structure/pattern in missing data and other observed data can not explain it, then it is Missing Not At Random (MNAR).\n","\n","* If the missing data does not fall under the MCAR or MAR then it can be categorized as MNAR.\n","\n","### It is important to handle the missing values appropriately.\n","\n","* Many machine learning algorithms fail if the dataset contains missing values. However, algorithms like <font color = 'red'>K-nearest and Naive Bayes </font>support data with missing values.\n","* You may end up building a biased machine learning model which will lead to incorrect results if the missing values are not handled properly.\n","Missing data can lead to a lack of precision in the statistical analysis.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gJgaUQ2bSooN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Lets Work on california-housing-prices\n","* downloading california-housing-prices data from kaggle.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3H1bBqPUfcLt"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":176},"id":"NJzDOGdIRWO7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664711381819,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12113,"user":{"displayName":"santhosh kurnapally","userId":"15491120331264307379"}},"outputId":"b62a269c-8b26-419e-d991-5bb6c0a03596"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-d7643c2f-fb88-41b9-b430-717772df5e34\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-d7643c2f-fb88-41b9-b430-717772df5e34\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
